h1. Rixel Flash 2D rendering engine

*Rixel*

h2. Goals

* Optimize rendering as much as possible in order to make games faster on computer and mobile environments
* Use methods and advice contained within "Flash Platform Optimization":http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/mobile/flashplatform_optimizing_content.pdf as a basis for initial design
* integrate Box2D for physics
* use as3-Signals for events
* Integrate a modular system for add-ons to add other functionality (ex. isometric rendering, box2D, parallax scrolling, particle effects, etc)
* create a matching Red5 server side application that will facilitate multiplayer games and interaction

h4. This project is on hold for a little while, I've had other projects pop up that are taking up most of my time. I've added a TODO FIXME task list which should explain current direction and current issues.
